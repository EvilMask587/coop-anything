# XCOM 2: War of the Chosen — co-op campaign notes

Running log. Observations, derived facts, guesses and unknowns are kept in separate lists.

## Goal (owner's design)
- Shared strategy layer (Avenger): both players can pick research/build/facility upgrades and
  edit any soldier.
- Squad select: each player picks their own squad (e.g. 4 + 4 = 8 on the field);
  a soldier picked by one player is locked for the other.
- Tactical: each player controls only their own soldiers; players alternate.
- 2 players, Steam, WotC + all DLC.

## Session 1 — 2026-10-24: triage + research

### Observed
- Game identity: see `local/identity.md` (Steam build 8270065, changelist 699444, UE3).
- Team Dragonpunk "XCOM 2: Tactical Co-Op", Workshop 792693587: status "Final", created
  3 Nov 2016, last updated 3 Sep 2017, 61.8 MB. Two-player tactical co-op on campaign
  missions, players split the squad; can import soldiers from the friend's game; no
  Ironman; both players must be in Squad Select when inviting. Team moved to other games.

- Steam app 602410 = "XCOM 2 War of the Chosen SDK" (installdir name in steamapps).

### Searched (nothing more found)
- web: "XCOM 2 co-op campaign mod", "Team Dragonpunk ... github source",
  "WOTC shared campaign multiplayer strategy layer XComGameStateNetworkManager"
- GitHub API repo search: "xcom2 coop", "dragonpunk xcom"
- coop-anything DIRECTORY/games/issues: no XCOM entry

### Unknown
- Whether Tactical Co-Op works on WotC (last update 5 days after WotC release; probably vanilla).
- Whether its Workshop package ships `Src/` (many XCOM 2 mods do).
- How the vanilla MP layer (XComGameStateNetworkManager) sends game states — read SDK source.
