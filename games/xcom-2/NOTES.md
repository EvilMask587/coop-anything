# XCOM 2: War of the Chosen — co-op campaign notes

Running log. Observations, derived facts, guesses and unknowns are kept in separate lists.

## Goal (owner's design)
- Shared strategy layer (Avenger): both players can pick research/build/facility upgrades and
  edit any soldier.
- Squad select: each player picks their own squad (e.g. 4 + 4 = 8 on the field);
  a soldier picked by one player is locked for the other.
- Tactical: each player controls only their own soldiers; players alternate.
- 2 players, Steam, WotC + all DLC.

## Session 1 — 2026-10-24: triage + research

### Observed
- Game identity: see `local/identity.md` (Steam build 8270065, changelist 699444, UE3).
- Team Dragonpunk "XCOM 2: Tactical Co-Op", Workshop 792693587: status "Final", created
  3 Nov 2016, last updated 3 Sep 2017, 61.8 MB. Two-player tactical co-op on campaign
  missions, players split the squad; can import soldiers from the friend's game; no
  Ironman; both players must be in Squad Select when inviting. Team moved to other games.

- No public source repo found (GitHub repo search "xcom2 coop", "dragonpunk xcom": 0 results).
- robojumper's "WOTC Multiplayer mods" (Workshop 1571537500) soft-deprecated in favour of a
  X2WOTCCommunityHighlander feature for mods in multiplayer.

- Steam app 602410 = "XCOM 2 War of the Chosen SDK" (installdir name in steamapps).

### Searched (nothing more found)
- web: "XCOM 2 co-op campaign mod", "Team Dragonpunk ... github source",
  "WOTC shared campaign multiplayer strategy layer XComGameStateNetworkManager"
- GitHub API repo search: "xcom2 coop", "dragonpunk xcom"
- coop-anything DIRECTORY/games/issues: no XCOM entry

### Unknown
- Whether Tactical Co-Op works on WotC (last update 5 days after WotC release; probably vanilla).
- Whether its Workshop package ships `Src/` (many XCOM 2 mods do).
- How the vanilla MP layer (XComGameStateNetworkManager) sends game states — read SDK source.

## Session 1 (cont.) — SDK source reading

SDK: Steam app 602410 "XCOM 2 War of the Chosen SDK", buildid 3075887, 4137 .uc files in
`<SDK>/Development/SrcOrig`. Community Highlander (MIT, github.com/X2CommunityCore/
X2WOTCCommunityHighlander, pushed 2026-10-12) cloned for reference.

### Observed (source, WotC SDK SrcOrig/XComGame/Classes)
- `XComGameStateNetworkManager` (native(MP), script-callable): CreateServer/CreateClient(URL),
  SendHistory, SendPartialHistory, SendGameState, SendMergeGameState, SendGameStateContext,
  SendRemoteCommand(string, array<byte>) + AddCommandParam_Int/String/Bool helpers,
  SendLoadTacticalMap, SendPlayerReady, SendSyncPoint, validation/desync reports.
  Delegates for every receive. `HasServerConnection/HasClientConnection`.
- `X2GameRuleset.SubmitGameStateContext`: if NetworkMgr.HasConnections() and the context
  was user input (`bSendGameState`), it is queued for sending; remote contexts
  (`bNetworkAdded`) reuse the sender's random seed.
- Shipped config `XComGame/Config/DefaultGame.ini:105 bPauseGameStateSending=true`:
  MP uses "active player is authority": active player runs the ruleset; at end of turn
  `SendPartialHistory`, remote replies "HistoryReceived", then "SwitchTurn"; the inactive
  player watches via `XComMPReplayMgr` (X2TacticalMPGameRuleset.uc ~300-360, 1095-1275).
- Remote-ness = `XComGameState_Player.GetGameStatePlayerNetId() != local UniqueId`
  (X2TacticalMPGameRuleset.GameStatePlayerOrGroupIsRemote).
- Transport: `UIMPShell_Lobby.CreateServer(Port=7777, bSteam)`: plain IP, or Steam sockets
  when URL op "steamsockets" is added. Engine NetworkDevice = IpNetDriverSteamworks.
- Cheat exec commands (XComCheatManager.uc 3697-4091): MPCreateServer, MPCreateClient,
  MPSendHistory, MPSetPauseGameStateSending, X2PrintNetworkDebug, MPCreateLobby, ...

### Derived (design direction, not yet tested)
- Tactical: keep ONE XCom player; split the XCom turn into sub-phases A then B. The
  sub-phase owner is the authority; handoff = SendPartialHistory + replay (same as MP
  end-turn). Alien/Lost/Chosen turns run on the host. Units carry an owner tag.
- Strategy: host-authoritative save; client gets full history on join (SendHistory).
  Edits via a "baton": one player edits at a time, handoff sends history. Later: per-object
  locks + SendMergeGameState for parallel soldier editing.
- Test transport: IP on 127.0.0.1, two instances on one PC (unknown if the exe allows it).

### Unknown
- Can two XCom2.exe instances run at once on one PC/Steam account?
- Does SendHistory work while in the strategy layer (Avenger), and does the client's
  visual state (Avenger, Geoscape) refresh after receiving it?
- Where test runs write config/logs (likely %USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\...).
